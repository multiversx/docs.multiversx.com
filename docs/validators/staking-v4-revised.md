# **1. Introduction**

## What is MultiversX staking?

Staking on MultiversX has reached its fourth iteration; also known as Staking v4 it now offers improved validator security and introduces a few new features designed to improve the staking experience and provide a non-biased 
validator rotation.

The core benefits Staking v4 offers for staking providers are mainly the intuitive validator dashboard, 
easy node management, and quick staking provider identity creation. Staking providers also have the ability to add 
or remove validator nodes easily and change network fees on the fly.

Compared to traditional staking mechanisms, MultiversX staking offers staking providers easy access, developer and technical support plus the ability to participate in protocol governance.

## Audience and Purpose

This document is intended for new staking providers that would like to start their journey with MultiversX and be part
 of our growing community of validators and providers.

While reading this document, you will be able to quickly understand and grasp the advantages of starting a Staking Provider on our protocol and fully reap the benefits while participating in one of the most stable protocols out there.

## Key Features and Advantages

**Security** is ensured by our Auction List mechanism that randomly selects 320 nodes, 80 nodes from each shard at every epoch start.The nodes are shuffled randomly to avoid collusion and to distribute the nodes across the shards. This contributes to the protocol security by maintaining a balanced network and avoiding concentration of power.
