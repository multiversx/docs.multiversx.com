# Execution going to a Sovereign Chain
![To Sovereign](../../static/sovereign/to-sovereign.png)

The ability to transfer tokens from the Main Chain to any Sovereign Chain is essential, since every Sovereign can connect to the Main MultiversX Chain. As a result, the customizable Sovereign can leverage any token available on the default network.

The transfer of tokens is done by the *ESDT-Safe* contract after calling the `deposit` endpoint inside the `to-sovereign` module. 

## Main Chain deposit to Sovereign Chain transfer flow
1. User deposits the tokens he wishes to transfer in the ESDT-Safe contract deployed on the Main Chain.
2. An observer is monitoring the Main Chain.
3. Sovereign network receives extended shard header.
4. Incoming transactions processor handles and processes the new transaction.

### Deposit Tokens
```rust
    #[payable("*")]
    #[endpoint]
    fn deposit(
        &self,
        to: ManagedAddress,
        optional_transfer_data: OptionalValueTransferDataTuple<Self::Api>,
    )
```

One key aspect of cross chain transfers from MultiversX Main Chain to a Sovereign Chain is being able to transfer tokens and also execute a smart contract call within single transaction. The `#[payable("*")]` annotation means that the endpoint can receive any tokens that will transferred. If those tokens are from a Sovereign Chain they will be burned otherwise they will be saved in the Smart Contract`s account. The checks enabled for the transfer of tokens are the following:

- If the token is whitelisted or not blacklisted, in that case the tokens can be transferred.
- If the fee is enabled, the smart contract assures that the fee is paid.
- If there are maximum 10 transfers in the transaction.

If the deposit also includes the `optional_transfer_data` parameter it will also have some extra checks regarding the cross-chain execution of endpoints:

- The gas limit must be under the specified limit.
- The endpoint that has to be executed is not blacklisted.


At the end of the `deposit` endpoint, all the extra tokens will be refunded to the caller and an event will be emitted since the bridging process is complete.


```rust
#[event("deposit")]
fn deposit_event(
    &self,
    #[indexed] dest_address: &ManagedAddress,
    #[indexed] tokens: &MultiValueEncoded<MultiValue3<TokenIdentifier, u64, EsdtTokenData>>,
    event_data: OperationData<Self::Api>,
)
```

This log event will emit the destination address and the tokens which will be transferred to the Sovereign Chain.
