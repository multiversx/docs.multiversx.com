[comment]: # (mx-abstract)

This page describes the Deep History Squad, which holds the entire trie data, so it can be used to query the state of an account at any point in time.

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

## Overview

A variant of the standard [**observing squad**](/integrators/observing-squad) is one that retains a non-pruned history of the blockchain and allows one to query the state of an account at an arbitrary block in the past. Such a setup is called a [**deep-history observing squad**](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-deep-history).

:::tip
The standard observing squad is sufficient for most use-cases. It is able to resolve past blocks, miniblocks, transactions, transaction events etc. Most often, you do not need a deep-history squad, but a [**regular observing squad**](/integrators/observing-squad), instead.
:::

A deep-history setup is able to resolve historical account (state) queries, that is, to answer questions such as:

> What was Alice's balance on [May the 4th](https://explorer.multiversx.com/blocks/5f6a02d6a5d2a851fd6dc1fb53435083830c2a13121e003958d97c2389711f06)?

```bash
GET http://squad:8080/address/erd1qyu5wthldzr8wx5c9ucg8kjagg0jfs53s8nr3zpz3hypefsdd8ssycr6th?blockNonce=9250000
```

:::tip
The API client has to perform the conversion from _desired timestamp_ to _block nonce_. Timestamp-based queries aren't directly supported yet.
:::

> How much UTK were in the [`UTK / WEGLD` Liquidity Pool](https://explorer.multiversx.com/accounts/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgq0lzzvt2faev4upyf586tg38s84d7zsaj2jpsglugga) on [1st of October](https://explorer.multiversx.com/blocks/cefd41e1e9bbe3ba023a695f412b99cecb15ef789475648ee7c31e7d9fef31d1)?

```markup
GET http://squad:8080/address/erd1qqqqqqqqqqqqqpgq0lzzvt2faev4upyf586tg38s84d7zsaj2jpsglugga/key/726573657276650000000a55544b2d326638306539?blockNonce=11410000
```

In the example above, the key `726573657276650000000a55544b2d326638306539` is decoded as `reserve\x00\x00\x00\nUTK-2f80e9`.

## MultiversX squad

The observing squads backing the public Gateways, in addition to being full history squads (serving past blocks, transactions and events up until the Genesis), also act as 3-epochs deep-history squads. That is, for **mainnet**, one can use https://gateway.multiversx.com to resolve historical account (state) queries, for the last 3 days. This interval is driven by the configuration parameter `[StoragePruning.NumEpochsToKeep]`, which is set to `4`, by default.

In general:

```
...                                  deep history not available
CurrentEpoch - NumEpochsToKeep - 1:  deep history not available
CurrentEpoch - NumEpochsToKeep:      deep history not available
CurrentEpoch - NumEpochsToKeep + 1:  deep history parially available
CurrentEpoch - NumEpochsToKeep + 2:  deep history available
CurrentEpoch - NumEpochsToKeep + 3:  deep history available 
...                                  deep history available
CurrentEpoch:                        deep history available
```

In particular, for the public Gateway:

```
...                 deep history not available
CurrentEpoch - 5:   deep history not available
CurrentEpoch - 4    deep history not available
CurrentEpoch - 3:   deep history parially available
CurrentEpoch - 2:   deep history available
CurrentEpoch - 1:   deep history available
CurrentEpoch:       deep history available
```

## On-premises squad

Deep-history squads can be set up on-premises, just as regular observing squads. However, the storage requirements is significantly higher. For example, a deep-history squad for **mainnet**, configured for the interval July 2020 (Genesis) - January 2024 (Sirius), requires about 7.5 TB of storage:

```
307G    ./node-metachain
1.4T    ./node-0
3.9T    ./node-1
2.0T    ./node-2
```

Since each observer of a deep-history squad must have a non-pruned history, their (non-ordinary) databases have to be either **downloaded** or **reconstructed**, in advance (covered later, in detail).

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

## Observer configuration

A deep history squad has its observers set up to retain the whole, non-pruned history of the blockchain. That is, the observers must be started with the flag `--operation-mode=historical-balances`.

:::tip
Apart from the flag mentioned above, the setup of a deep-history observer is identical to a regular full-history observer.
:::

:::warning
Never attach a non-pruned database to a regular observer (i.e. that does not have the above **operation-mode**) - unless you are not interested into the deep-history features. The regular observer irremediably removes, trucates and prunes the data (as configured, for storage efficiency).

## Downloading non-pruned database

Archives supporting historical lookup are available to download from a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

## Reconstructing non-pruned databases

An alternative to downloading the non-pruned history is to reconstruct it locally (on your own infrastructure). The reconstruction process is, generally speaking, based on the **[import-db](/validators/import-db/)** feature, which re-processes past blocks - and, while doing so, retains the whole, non-pruned accounts history. However, it's also possible to reconstruct the history by performing a regular sync (e.g. from Genesis) using a properly configured deep-history observer.

First, you need to decide whether to reconstruct a **complete** or a **partial** history. A _complete_ history provides the deep-history squad the ability to resolve historical account (state) queries **up until the Genesis**. A _partial_ history, instead, allows it to resolve state queries up until **a chosen past epoch** or **between two chosen epochs**.

:::note
The reconstruction flow has to be performed **for each shard, separately**.
:::

[comment]: # (mx-context-auto)

### Reconstruct a complete history

:::note
Below, the reconstruction is exemplified for **mainnet, shard 0**. The same applies to other networks (devnet, testnet) and shards (including the metachain). Furthermore, the example refers to the latest Protocol release as of January 2024 (Sirius). When reconstructing the history, use the latest release available.
:::

First, set up the reconstruction workspace in a folder of your choice (for the chosen shard), as follows:

```
# In most cases, this should be the latest tag:
# https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-mainnet-config/releases/latest
export CONFIG_TAG=v1.6.13.0

# Clone mainnet config into a folder named "config"
git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-mainnet-config --branch=$CONFIG_TAG --single-branch --depth=1 config

# In most cases, this should be the tag found in the file "config/binaryVersion":
export BINARY_TAG=$(cat ./config/binaryVersion | sed 's/tags\///')

# Clone and build the node binary
git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go.git --branch=$BINARY_TAG --single-branch --depth=1
go build -C mx-chain-go/cmd/node -o $(pwd)/node
```

Then, get (download) and extract **a recent daily archive (snapshot)** for the shard in question (e.g. shard 0). The daily archives are available to download **on request** ([Discord](https://discord.gg/multiversxbuilders) or [Telegram](https://t.me/MultiversXValidators)), from a cloud-based, _S3-compatible storage_ (Digital Ocean Spaces) - or you could fetch them from an existing regular full-history observer that you own. 

Upon extracting the downloaded archive, you'll have a new folder in your workspace: `db`, which contains the blockchain data for the shard in question. This data should be moved to a new folder, named `import-db`. All in all, the steps are as follows:

```
# Ask for the full download link on Discord or Telegram:
wget https://.../23-Jan-2024/Full-History-DB-Shard-0.tar.gz
# This produces a new folder: "db"
tar -xf Full-History-DB-Shard-0.tar.gz

# "import-db" should contain the whole blockchain to be re-processed
mkdir -p ./import-db && mv db ./import-db
# "db" will contain the reconstructed database (empty at first)
mkdir -p ./db
```

:::note
Downloading the archives and extracting them might take a while.
:::

Now, the reconstruction workspace should look as follows (irrelevant files omitted):

```
.
├── config          # network configuration files
├── import-db
│   └── db          # blockchain data
├── db              # empty
└── node            # binary file, the Node itself
```

We are ready to start the reconstruction process :rocket:

```
./node --import-db=./import-db --operation-mode=historical-balances --import-db-no-sig-check --log-level=*:INFO --log-save --destination-shard-as-observer 0
```

:::note
The reconstruction (which uses _import-db_ under the hood, as previously stated) takes a long time (e.g. days) - depending on the machine's resources (CPU, storage capabilities and memory).
:::

Once the **import-db** is over, the `db` folder contains the reconstructed database for the shard in question, ready to be attached to a deep-history observer (observer with the **operation-mode** mentioned above).

Now, do the same for the other shards, as needed.

:::tip
You can smoke test the data by launching an (in-place) ephemeral observer:

```
./node --operation-mode=historical-balances --log-save --destination-shard-as-observer 0
```

Then, in another terminal, do a historical (state) query against the ephemeral observer:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/address/erd1spyavw0956vq68xj8y4tenjpq2wd5a9p2c6j8gsz7ztyrnpxrruqzu66jx?blockNonce=42 | jq
```

### Reconstruct a partial history

:::tip
Make sure to read the section [**Reconstruct a complete history**](#reconstruct-a-complete-history) first, to understand the basics.
:::

Instead of reconstructing the whole history since Genesis, you may want to reconstruct a partial history, starting from a chosen epoch up until the latest epoch, or a history between two chosen epochs.

Below, we'll take the example of reconstructing the history for epochs `1255 - 1260` (inclusive), for **mainnet, shard 0**. 

First, set up the reconstruction workspace in a folder of your choice, the same as for reconstructing a complete history (see above). That is:

```
git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-mainnet-config --branch=$CONFIG_TAG --single-branch --depth=1 config
git clone https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-go.git --branch=$BINARY_TAG --single-branch --depth=1
go build -C mx-chain-go/cmd/node -o $(pwd)/node
```

Then, since we'd like to stop upon reconstruction of epoch `1260` (our example), we enable the `BlockProcessingCutoff` feature in `config/prefs.toml`:

```
[BlockProcessingCutoff]
   Enabled = true
   Mode = "pause"
   CutoffTrigger = "epoch"
   # The chosen end epoch, plus 1.
   Value = 1261
```

Now, get (download) and extract **two daily archives (snapshots)** for the shard in question (e.g. shard 0): one archive that was created on the epoch preceding the **chosen start epoch** (e.g. the archive created during epoch `1255 - 1 = 1254`); and one archive that was created on the epoch following the **chosen end epoch** (e.g. the archive created during epoch `1260 + 1 = 1261`). You can compute the correct URLs for the two archives manually, given the [**mainnet** Genesis time](https://gateway.multiversx.com/network/config) and the chosen epochs, or you can use the following Python snippet:

```
import datetime

# Available on request (Discord or Telegram)
url_base = "https://..."
shard = 0
chosen_start_epoch = 1255
chosen_end_epoch = 1260
genesis_timestamp = 1596117600

genesis_datetime = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(genesis_timestamp, tz=datetime.timezone.utc)
first_archive_day = (genesis_datetime + datetime.timedelta(days=chosen_start_epoch - 1)).strftime("%d-%b-%Y")
second_archive_day = (genesis_datetime + datetime.timedelta(days=chosen_end_epoch + 1)).strftime("%d-%b-%Y")

print("First daily archive:", f"{url_base}/{first_archive_day}/Full-History-DB-Shard-{shard}.tar.gz")
print("Second daily archive:", f"{url_base}/{second_archive_day}/Full-History-DB-Shard-{shard}.tar.gz")
```

The first archive should be used as `db` and the second archive should be used as `import-db/db`.

```
# Download & extract first archive to "db":
wget https://.../05-Jan-2024/Full-History-DB-Shard-0.tar.gz
tar -xf Full-History-DB-Shard-0.tar.gz

# Download & extract second archive to "import-db/db":
wget https://.../12-Jan-2024/Full-History-DB-Shard-0.tar.gz
mkdir -p ./import-db
tar -xf Full-History-DB-Shard-0.tar.gz --directory ./import-db
```

The reconstruction workspace should look as follows (irrelevant files omitted):

```
.
├── config          # network configuration files
├── import-db
│   └── db          # blockchain data (second archive)
├── db              # blockchain data (first archive)
└── node            # binary file, the Node itself
```

We are now ready to start the reconstruction process :rocket:

```
./node --import-db=./import-db --operation-mode=historical-balances --import-db-no-sig-check --log-level=*:INFO --log-save --destination-shard-as-observer 0
```

Once the **import-db** is over, the `db` folder can be attached to a deep-history observer to support historical account (state) queries for the epochs `1255 - 1260`.

## Historical VM queries

:::important
Documentation in this section is preliminary and subject to change.
:::

Starting with the [Sirius Mainnet Upgrade](https://github.com/multiversx/mx-specs/blob/main/releases/protocol/release-specs-v1.6.0-Sirius.md), deep-history observers can resolve VM queries up to `[StoragePruning.NumActivePersisters]` (by default, 3) epochs in the past. Such a query specifies the `blockNonce` parameter:

```
POST http://localhost:8080/vm-values/query?blockNonce={...} HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "scAddress": "...",
  "funcName": "...",
  "args": [ ... ]
}
```

VM queries that refer older data aren't supported as of January 2024 (Sirius). This will be fixed in a future release.

## Starting a squad

Suppose you have prepared the data for a deep-history squad beforehand, whether by downloading it or by reconstructing it locally. Then, the deep-history data root folder should look as follows:

```
.
├── mainnet
│   ├── node-0
│   │   └── db
│   ├── node-1
│   │   └── db
│   ├── node-2
│   │   └── db
│   └── node-metachain
│       └── db
└── devnet
    ├── ...
```

The squad can be started using docker-compose (the example is for **mainnet**):

```
# Download the docker-compose configuration (skip this step if performed before)
wget https://github.com/multiversx/mx-chain-deep-history/blob/main/docker-compose.yml

# Possible profiles: squad-mainnet, squad-mainnet-0, squad-mainnet-1, squad-mainnet-2, squad-mainnet-metachain, squad-mainnet-proxy
DEEP_HISTORY_DATA=${HOME}/deep-history-data DOCKER_USER=$(id -u):$(id -g) docker compose \
    --file ./docker-compose.yml \
    --profile squad-mainnet \
    --project-name deep-history-squad-mainnet up --detach
```

Alternatively, you can set up a squad using any other known approach, **but make sure to apply the proper `operation-mode`** described in the section [**Observer configuration**](#observer-configuration).

**Congratulations!** You've set up a deep-history observing squad; the gateway should be ready to resolve historical account (state) queries :rocket:
