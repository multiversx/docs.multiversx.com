## About api.elrond.com

`api.elrond.com` is a wrapper over `gateway.elrond.com` that brings a robust caching mechanism, alongside Elasticsearch 
historical queries support, tokens media support, delegation & staking data, and many others.

## Dependencies

### Core dependencies 
For its basic functionality (without including caching or storage improvements), api.elrond.com depends on the following external systems:

- `gateway`: also referred as Proxy, provides access to node information, such as network settings, account balance, sending transactions, etc
        docs: [Proxy](/sdk-and-tools/proxy).
- `index`: a database that indexes data that can be queries, such as transactions, blocks, nfts, etc.
        docs: [Elasticsearc](/sdk-and-tools/elastic-search).
- `delegation`: a microservice used to fetch providers list from the delegation API. Not currently open for public access.

### Other dependencies
It uses on the following internal systems:

- redis: used to cache various data, for performance purposes
- rabbitmq: pub/sub for sending mainly NFT process information from the transaction processor instance to the queue worker instance

It depends on the following optional external systems:

- events notifier rabbitmq: queue that pushes logs & events which are handled internally e.g. to trigger NFT media fetch
- data: provides eGLD price information for transactions
- maiar exchange: provides price information regarding various tokens listed on the maiar exchange
- ipfs: ipfs gateway for fetching mainly NFT metadata & media files
- media: ipfs gateway which will be used as prefix for NFT media & metadata returned in the NFT details
- media internal: caching layer for ipfs data to fetch from a centralized system such as S3 for performance reasons
- AWS S3: used to process newly minted NFTs & uploads their thumbnails
- github: used to fetch provider profile & node information from github

It uses the following optional internal systems:

- mysql database: used to store mainly NFT media & metadata information
- mongo database: used to store mainly NFT media & metadata information

## Ways to start api.elrond.com

An API instance can be started with the following behavior:

- public API: provides REST API for the consumers
- private API: used to report prometheus metrics & health checks
- transaction processor & completed: fetches real-time transactions & logs from the blockchain; takes action based on various events, such as clearing cache values and publishing events on a queue
- cache warmer: used to proactively fetch data & pushes it to cache, to improve performance & scalability
- elastic updater: used to attach various extra information to items in the elasticsearch, for not having to fetch associated data from other external systems when performing listing requests
- events notifier: perform various decisions based on incoming logs & events

## Rate limiting

Currently, there is a rate limit mechanism that limits an IP address to a maximum of 2 requests / second.

## Rest API documentation

Rest API documentation of `api.elrond.com` can be found on the [Swagger docs](https://api.elrond.com).
